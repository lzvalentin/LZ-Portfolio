# LZ-Portfolio
## Description

Created a portfolio from scratch. The reason for the portfolio is to showcase my skills and talents to help me in the future when I am on a job search. 

In the portfolio you will see flexbox, links working to designated sites and/or pages. Only one not set with a link is the "Resume" link in the header/nav section as I have not created a new one. Images have a hover over them. Added comments to CSS to explain the code.
