# LZ-Portfolio
## Description

The reason for the portfolio is to showcase my skills and talents to help me in the future when I am on a job search. 

In the portfolio you will see flexbox, links working to designated sites and/or pages. Images have a hover over them. Added comments to CSS to explain the code.

## User Story
AS someone who is developing new skills and wants to show case them 
I WANT to have a portfolio that future employers can view.

Given the porfolio,
WHEN I open the page, THEN I can click the links in the nav section. 
WHEN I scroll down, THEN I can click the images that will open projects previously worked on.
When I continue to scroll down to the contact me section, THEN I can click the links of contact by phone, email, github & linkedin.
